        <p>
          I went to Japan. Silly stuff happened. I decided to make a comic.

        <p>
          To quote myself, I originally intended to produce a <em>"semi-serious, somewhat autobiographical, possibly humorous, slightly crude, pseudo-philosophical, downright silly artistic rambling of my time in Japan."</em> For most part, I think I've met the mark on the humor, crudeness, and silliness. (Yep, we were a silly bunch)

          The comic currently stops at Nara, which also just about marks the point where I set off on my solo leg of the trip. I suppose that was where the "serious" and "philsophical" were supposed to come in, but I've decided to put this project on hold for now, though I foresee making the occasional update.

          I draw silly things, and beautiful things, but I also need more practice. A lot more practice. This comic was originally published on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1963589403919203.1073741835.100008044871830&type=1&l=9939bb0863">Facebook</a>.
